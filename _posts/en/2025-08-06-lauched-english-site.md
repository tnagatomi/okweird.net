I've launched an English version of my site today, along with my Japanese pages.

My site runs on Ruby on Rails with Parklife, which can statically build Rack-based apps. I used to use Hugo, but migrated to this combination after being inspired by Ben Sheldon's post: [Living Parklife with Rails, coming from Jekyll \| Island94.org](https://island94.org/2025/01/living-parklife-with-rails-coming-from-jekyll).  
Thanks to Rails, internationalizing the site was straightforward.

Why launch English pages?

Well, I started posting on Bluesky in English after what happened to Twitter, and was able to gain followers from outside my home country, Japan.  
I wanted to do the same with my site.

I hope to post occasionally about various topics here.  
See you soon!
